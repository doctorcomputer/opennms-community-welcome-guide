\section{Support Tools}
The development process is very active. Many developers around the world improve the code and add new features. To control our development and track issues we use different tools in our project. Most of the tools are maintained by the OpenNMS Group and all of them are publicly available. This section gives an short overview where you can find the tools and how they are used.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Atlassian JIRA}: is used as issue tracker. You can document bugs create feature requests to enhance the software. The application can be found on \url{http://issues.opennms.org}. To create a good bug report or feature request for an enhancement it is necessary to provide some information. You find an introduction using JIRA on the wiki page \url{http://JIRA-WIKI-USAGE}.
  \item \emph{Atlassian Bamboo}: is used as continuos integration system. The codebase from GitHub is checked out and will be compiled, tested and deployed. You can find the build system on \url{http://bamboo.internal.opennms.com:8085}.
  \item \emph{Atlassian FishEye}: is used as a code browser. It allows developers to visualize changes in the code base. You can also have a look at the code to understand how a special monitor works in detail without check out the code with \emph{git}. The code browser is available on \url{http://fisheye.opennms.org}.
