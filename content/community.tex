\section{OpenNMS Community}
In \emph{OpenNMS} we have a global community consisting of developers, corporations, service providers, researchers and users. The following section will give you a short overview which main roles exist in the community.

\subsection*{The OpenNMS Group, Inc.}
The OpenNMS Group, Inc. is the biggest sponsor to the project. The software itself is licensed under GPLv3+. The company \emph{The OpenNMS Group, Inc.} provides professional support and gives people a place who want to spend significant time of their life to the project. Code development in commercial environment is reflected as a code contribution to the free software project. Beside code contribution there are other topics like packaging and continuos integration which is also provided publicly to the project.

\subsection*{Order of the Green Polo}
The super secret brotherhood (OGP) and developers of the \emph{OpenNMS Project}. You can recognize and \emph{OGP} member by their good looks as well as their super-flashy, very coveted \emph{OpenNMS Green Polo}. As Tarus Balog said:

Back in fall of 2004, I wanted to find a way to recognize those people who make \emph{OpenNMS} what it is, and to thank them in some fashion. 
Ever since the advent of "business casual" workplace attire, the "logo" polo shirt has become a fixture in IT departments around the world. We sell black and white polos with the \emph{OpenNMS} logo on our web site.

But this is much, much, much, different. These are "green" polos, very rare, and they will never be available for sale. Think of them as equivalent to winning \emph{The Masters} golf tournament's green jacket - only harder to get.
In order to get one, all one has to do is give up all hope of having a life outside of \emph{OpenNMS}, work long hours for free, and basically become a closed superhero, squashing bugs (or uncovering existence) in a single bound.

\subsection*{OpenNMS Foundation Europe}
The \emph{OpenNMS Foundation Europe e.V.} (OFE) was founded in July 31st. OFE is a registered non-profit organization in Germany. The objective of the organization is to promote, develop, educate and research around free software and network (management) technologies, especially \emph{OpenNMS}. To do this, the \emph{OFE} organizes the OpenNMS User Conference Europe (OUCE) running by foundation members and volunteers. The OFE web site with links to material of the conference can be found under \url{http://www.opennms.eu}.
