\section{Get in contact}
Communication is very important. The main communication established over many years is the mailing list and the IRC channel. For generic questions the OFE provides also a question and answer platform under \url{http://ask.opennms.eu}. For discussions and exchanging experiences in the world around network management, we provide different mailing lists. The different list topics can be found in on the wiki page in \url{http://www.opennms.org/wiki/<linkhere>}. 
As a direct communication channel we use IRC. This is the place where you can find a lot of guys hanging around. We follow in our communication netiquette, respect each other and don't click on links ;) The OpenNMS people can be found in IRC on \url{irc://irc.freenode.org} on channel \texttt{\#opennms}. If you want to volunteer the OUCE or you want to help improving the project you can get in contact with OGPs or using the mailing list. You can find a volunteer link on \url{http://www.opennms.eu}.
