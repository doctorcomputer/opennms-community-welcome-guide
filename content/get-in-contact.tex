\section{Get in contact}
Communication is very important. The main communication established over many years is the mailing list and the IRC channel. Mailing list sounds not very Web-2.0ish but it has a low barrier to entry and gives you the freedom to just listen or actively ask and answer questions to others. The second more direct communication form is the IRC channel, where you can find a lot of guys hanging around. We follow the netiquette - respect each other. The most important rules: follow the netiquette, respect each other and don't click on links. The IRC channel can be found on \url{irc://irc.freenode.org} on channel \texttt{\#opennms}.
There are mailing lists for different topics. The following section gives you a short overview which topic is covered and maybe interesting for you:

\begin{itemize}
